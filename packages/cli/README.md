# vent-hq

**Agent CLI for voice AI development.** Lets coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Windsurf) place real calls against your voice agent and read back transcripts, latency, audio, tool calls, and 60+ computed metrics — so they can iterate on prompts, flows, and platform config based on what actually happened.

Works with **Vapi, Retell, LiveKit, ElevenLabs, Bland, and custom WebSocket endpoints**.

```bash
npx vent-hq@latest init
```

## How it works

1. Your coding agent writes a Vent caller config (`.vent/suite.json`) with a persona and a call goal.
2. It runs `vent-hq run -f .vent/suite.json`. Vent joins the call as a voice caller, drives the conversation, and records everything.
3. Vent returns a single JSON result: full transcript, recorded audio URL, per-turn latency, tool-call trace, and call metadata. Your agent reads it and decides what to change.

The agent is the brain. Vent is the instrument.

## Install

```bash
npx vent-hq@latest init
```

`init` will:
- Authenticate via GitHub (if you have `gh` installed) or open a browser for device-code auth
- Install skill files for Claude Code (`.claude/skills/vent/SKILL.md`), Cursor (`.cursor/rules/vent.mdc`), Codex (`AGENTS.md`), and Windsurf (`.windsurf/skills/vent/SKILL.md`)
- Scaffold a starter suite at `.vent/suite.json`

After `init`, your coding agent reads the skill file and takes over from there.

## Example suite

```json
{
  "connection": {
    "adapter": "vapi",
    "vapi_assistant_id": "asst_..."
  },
  "calls": {
    "happy-path": {
      "caller_prompt": "You're a customer wanting to book a haircut for Friday at 3pm. Be friendly but a little vague about the date at first.",
      "max_turns": 8
    }
  }
}
```

Set `VAPI_API_KEY` in `.env` and run:

```bash
npx vent-hq run -f .vent/suite.json
```

Swap `adapter` for `retell`, `livekit`, `elevenlabs`, `bland`, or `websocket` to target a different platform. See [the docs](https://docs.vent.dev) for the per-platform connection block.

## Commands

| Command                             | Purpose                                                    |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `vent-hq init`                      | One-time setup: auth, skill files, starter suite           |
| `vent-hq run -f <suite.json>`       | Run a call (or all calls) from a suite, stream results     |
| `vent-hq run -f <s> --call <name>`  | Run a single named call                                    |
| `vent-hq stop <run-id>`             | Cancel a queued or running call                            |
| `vent-hq agent start -f <s>`        | Keep a relay session open for a local WebSocket agent      |
| `vent-hq login` / `logout`          | Manage credentials                                         |

Run `vent-hq <command> --help` for command-specific options.

## What you get back

Every `run` returns a single JSON object on stdout. Shape:

```json
{
  "run_id": "01J...",
  "status": "complete",
  "calls": [
    {
      "name": "happy-path",
      "status": "complete",
      "duration_ms": 42180,
      "latency": { "p50_ms": 612, "p95_ms": 1180, "time_to_first_audio_ms": 540 },
      "transcript": [
        { "role": "agent", "text": "Hi, this is Acme Salon, how can I help?" },
        { "role": "caller", "text": "Hey, I'd like to book a haircut for Friday." }
      ],
      "tool_calls": [{ "name": "check_availability", "args": {...}, "result": {...} }],
      "recording_url": "https://...",
      "call_metadata": { ... }
    }
  ]
}
```

Verbose fields are gated behind `--verbose` to keep agent context lean.

## Platform notes

- **Vapi, Retell, ElevenLabs** — hosted only. Set the API key + assistant/agent ID in `.env`.
- **LiveKit** — works against local dev agents and LiveKit Cloud with the same config (different `LIVEKIT_URL`). Install [`@vent-hq/livekit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vent-hq/livekit) (Node) or [`vent-livekit`](https://pypi.org/project/vent-livekit/) (Python) for tool-call and component-latency observability.
- **Bland** — supports pathways (`bland_pathway_id`), personas (`persona_id`), or inline `task` prompts.
- **Custom (WebSocket)** — point at a hosted endpoint with `agent_url`, or run a local agent with `start_command` + `agent_port`. Vent tunnels audio through a relay so your machine doesn't need a public IP.

Platform credentials are encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM) and never appear in chat logs or run payloads.
